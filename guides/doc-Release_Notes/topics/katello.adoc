== Headline Features

=== Custom repository sets switching to disabled-by-default
Custom products are now disabled by default in Katello.
During the upgrade to Katello 4.9, content overrides will be automatically added so that existing hosts and activation keys have access to the same repositories before and after the upgrade.
Going forward, newly created custom products will be disabled by default.

=== Immediate repository changes on hosts after changing content view or lifecycle environment
When changing a host's content view environment, you can now update the host's package profile via REX by checking a checkbox.
This will allow the host's errata and package info to update immediately.

=== Standardized search bars across UI React pages
The Search input (including Bookmarks) in Katello on React pages has been standardized and now matches the one in Foreman.

=== Localization improvements
More text in the UI and Hammer should now be translated thanks to updates to translation infrastructure across Foreman plugins.

=== Content view publish recommendations
Katello now tells users if a content view publish is unnecessary based on changes to repositories and filters.
Likewise, new icons in the UI will communicate if a new version should be published to receive new updates.

=== Content view version filtering history
Content view versions that had filters applied will receive a new flag in the UI.
Filters that were applied to previous content view versions are now available to fetch from the API and Hammer.

=== Incremental update dependency solving option in UI
Dependency solving during incremental updates via the UI is now optional.
A checkbox with some information will allow the user to disable it for a potential publishing speed increase.

=== Repository sets are now filterable by type
You can now filter Repository sets by repository type - Red Hat or Custom.
